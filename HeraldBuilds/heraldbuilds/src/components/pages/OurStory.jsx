          Herald Builds was founded by a group of 4 passionate PC enthusiasts
          who believed that building a computer should be accessible to
          everyone. What started as a small community of tech enthusiasts
          helping friends build their first PCs has grown into a comprehensive
          resource for PC builders worldwide
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in Nairobi, Kenya, we're proud to be contributing to the
          growing tech community in East Africa while serving PC builders
          globally
